# Basic Blog

This is a chance for me to review the Getting Started with Rail tutorial and building a basic blog application with two associated models and basic authentication.

* Ruby version - 3.0.0

### Topics for me to learn more about:
* Concerns - what are differneces between module and class? How are concerns typically used? What ways can I practice with them to get more comfortable.
* Authentication - The guide recommends Devise or Authlogic gem.
* Helpers - such as link_to and model_path
